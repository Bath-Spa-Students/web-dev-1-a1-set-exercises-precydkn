                The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (時をかける少女, <i>Toki o Kakeru Shōjo</i>) is a 2006 Japanese-animated science fiction 
                romance film produced by Madhouse, directed by Mamoru Hosoda and written by Satoko Okudera. Distributed by Kadokawa 
                Herald Pictures, the film is a loose sequel to the 1967 novel of the same name by Yasutaka Tsutsui and shares the 
                basic premise of a teenage girl who gains the power of time travel and repeatedly relives the same day in a time loop, 
                but with a different story and characters than the novel. Riisa Naka voices teenager Makoto Konno, who learns from 
                Kazuko Yoshiyama, Makoto's aunt and the protagonist to the original story, that Makoto has the power to travel through 
                time. Makoto begins using the time-leaps frivolously to fix problems. Riisa Naka later portrays Makoto's cousin, 
                Akari Yoshiyama, the protagonist of the 2010 live-action film Time Traveller: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, which 
                follows a different story.<br><br>
                
                The Girl Who Leapt Through Time was released on July 15, 2006, and received positive reviews. It won numerous awards, 
                including the Japan Academy Film Prize for Animation of the Year. The English version was licensed and produced by 
                Kadokawa Pictures U.S., with dubbing supplied by Ocean Productions, and released by Bandai Entertainment in 2008 and 
                re-released by Funimation in 2016.

                <!--overview of plot, key information-->
                At Kuranose High School in Tokyo, Japan, 17-year-old Makoto Konno discovers a message written on a blackboard 
                and ends up inadvertently falling onto a walnut-shaped object. On her way to the Tokyo National Museum to meet 
                with her aunt, Kazuko Yoshiyama, she is ejected into a railroad crossing when the brakes on her bicycle fail and 
                hit by an oncoming train, but finds herself transported back in time when she was riding her bicycle right before 
                the accident. After telling Kazuko what happened, she helps Makoto realize she now has the power to "time-leap", 
                the ability to literally travel through time. At first, Makoto uses her powers to avoid being late, get perfect 
                grades, avoid mishaps and even relive a single karaoke session for several hours, but soon discovers her actions 
                can adversely affect others.<br><br>

                Consequently, Makoto uses most of her leaps frivolously to prevent undesirable situations from happening, including 
                an awkward love confession from her best friend, Chiaki Mamiya. Makoto realizes she has a numbered tattoo on her arm 
                indicating the limited number of times she can time leap. Using her remaining time leaps, Makoto attempts to make 
                things right for everyone. When Chiaki calls Makoto to ask if she has been time-leaping, she uses her final time-leap 
                to prevent Chiaki's call. In the meantime, Makoto's friend Kōsuke Tsuda and his new girlfriend, Kaho Fujitani, borrow 
                her faulty bike. Makoto attempts to stop them, but as she had just used her final leap, she is unable to rescue them 
                from being hit by the train.<br><br>
                
                A moment later, Chiaki freezes time. Telling Makoto he is from the future, he explains the walnut-shaped object is his 
                time-traveling device, and used it to time-leap hoping to see a painting that Kazuko is restoring, as it has been destroyed 
                in the future. While walking with Makoto in the frozen city, Chiaki explains why he stayed longer in her time than he 
                originally planned. Consequently, he has used his final leap to prevent Kōsuke and Kaho from the train accident and he 
                has stopped time only to explain to Makoto he is unable to return to his own time period, and having revealed his origins 
                and the nature of the item that allowed Makoto to leap through time, Chiaki must leave. Then Makoto realizes she is in 
                love with him.<br><br>

                True to his words, Chiaki disappears once time resumes. Initially distraught by Chiaki's disappearance, Makoto discovers 
                Chiaki's time-leap inadvertently restored her final time-leap: Chiaki leaped back to the time before Makoto used it. Makoto 
                uses it to safely leap back to the moment right after she originally gained her powers; Chiaki would still have his one 
                remaining time-leap. Recovering the used up time-travel device, she explains her knowledge of everything as she shows it to 
                Chiaki. Makoto vows to ensure the painting's existence so Chiaki can see it in his era. Before Chiaki departs, he tells 
                Makoto he will be waiting for her in the future. When Kōsuke asks her where Chiaki went, she tells him Chiaki went to study 
                abroad. She has made a decision about her own future.<br><br>

                The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 84% approval rating based on 19 reviews, with an average 
                rating of 6.6/10. The website's consensus reads: 
                <blockquote>
                    <i>"An imaginative and thoughtfully engaging anime film with a highly 
                    effective visual design. This coming-of-age comedy drama has mad inventiveness to spare."</i>
                </blockquote>
                On Metacritic, the movie 
                has an average score of 66 out of 100, which indicates <span>"generally favorable reviews"</span>.<br><br>
                
                Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network praised the film for its <span>"absolute magic.</span>" Sevakis felt that the film has <span>"more 
                in common with the best shoujo manga than [author Yasutaka] Tsutsui's other work Paprika"</span>. He said that the voice acting 
                has <span>"the right amount of realism [for the film]"</span>. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's visuals and pace. He 
                also compared the film to the works of Studio Ghibli. Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice said, 
                <blockquote>
                    <i>"there's real craftsmanship 
                    for how [the film] sustains its sense of summer quietude and sun-soaked haziness through a few carefully reprised motifs: 
                    three-cornered games of catch, mountainous cloud formations, classroom still-lifes."</i>
                </blockquote>
                Pinkerton also said that the film is 
                <blockquote>
                    <i>"the equivalent of a sensitively wrought read from the Young Adult shelf, and there's naught wrong with that."</i>
                </blockquote>
                Author 
                Yasutaka Tsutsui praised the film as being <span>"a true second-generation"</span> of his book at the Tokyo International Anime Fair on 
                March 24, 2006.
