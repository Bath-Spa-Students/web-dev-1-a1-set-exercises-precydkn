                The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (時をかける少女, <i>Toki o Kakeru Shōjo</i>) is a 2006 Japanese-animated science fiction 
                romance film produced by Madhouse, directed by Mamoru Hosoda and written by Satoko Okudera. Distributed by Kadokawa 
                Herald Pictures, the film is a loose sequel to the 1967 novel of the same name by Yasutaka Tsutsui and shares the 
                basic premise of a teenage girl who gains the power of time travel and repeatedly relives the same day in a time loop, 
                but with a different story and characters than the novel. Riisa Naka voices teenager Makoto Konno, who learns from 
                Kazuko Yoshiyama, Makoto's aunt and the protagonist to the original story, that Makoto has the power to travel through 
                time. Makoto begins using the time-leaps frivolously to fix problems. Riisa Naka later portrays Makoto's cousin, 
                Akari Yoshiyama, the protagonist of the 2010 live-action film Time Traveller: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, which 
                follows a different story.<br><br>
                
                The Girl Who Leapt Through Time was released on July 15, 2006, and received positive reviews. It won numerous awards, 
                including the Japan Academy Film Prize for Animation of the Year. The English version was licensed and produced by 
                Kadokawa Pictures U.S., with dubbing supplied by Ocean Productions, and released by Bandai Entertainment in 2008 and 
                re-released by Funimation in 2016.
