                The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 84% approval rating based on 19 reviews, with an average 
                rating of 6.6/10. The website's consensus reads: 
                <blockquote>
                    <i>"An imaginative and thoughtfully engaging anime film with a highly 
                    effective visual design. This coming-of-age comedy drama has mad inventiveness to spare."</i>
                </blockquote>
                On Metacritic, the movie 
                has an average score of 66 out of 100, which indicates <span>"generally favorable reviews"</span>.<br><br>
                
                Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network praised the film for its <span>"absolute magic.</span>" Sevakis felt that the film has <span>"more 
                in common with the best shoujo manga than [author Yasutaka] Tsutsui's other work Paprika"</span>. He said that the voice acting 
                has <span>"the right amount of realism [for the film]"</span>. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's visuals and pace. He 
                also compared the film to the works of Studio Ghibli. Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice said, 
                <blockquote>
                    <i>"there's real craftsmanship 
                    for how [the film] sustains its sense of summer quietude and sun-soaked haziness through a few carefully reprised motifs: 
                    three-cornered games of catch, mountainous cloud formations, classroom still-lifes."</i>
                </blockquote>
                Pinkerton also said that the film is 
                <blockquote>
                    <i>"the equivalent of a sensitively wrought read from the Young Adult shelf, and there's naught wrong with that."</i>
                </blockquote>
                Author 
                Yasutaka Tsutsui praised the film as being <span>"a true second-generation"</span> of his book at the Tokyo International Anime Fair on 
                March 24, 2006.
