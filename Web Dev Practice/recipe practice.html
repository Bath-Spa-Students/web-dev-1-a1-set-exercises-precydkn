        <li>Stir in garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until garlic gets aromatic.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, cream of chicken soup, rice and cook for a few minutes until the rice cooks through.</li>
        <li>Add in the broccoli and cheese and continue cooking for a couple more minutes until the broccoli softens.</li>
        <li>Top with more cheese and cover with the lid so that the cheese melts. <i>(You can also place the skillet (if it’s oven safe) 
            in the oven under the broiler for a couple minutes until the cheese starts to brown a bit. <br>
            If your skillet is not oven safe, you can still do this by transferring the rice mixture to a casserole dish first.)</i></li>
